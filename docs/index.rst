LATISS, the LSST Atmospheric Transmission Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, is installed on the Rubin Auxiliary Telescope, a 1.2-meter telescope dedicated to atmospheric characterization at the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory site.
It uses a 4k x 4k CCD, made by `ITL <https://www.itl.arizona.edu/capabilities>`_, of the same type as used on `LSSTCam <https://lsstcam.lsst.io>`_.
It is designed to measure atmospheric transmission and calibrate LSST observations by taking spectra of standard stars.
